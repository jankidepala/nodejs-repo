### CONCEPTS::
#### Buffer :
Mechanism for reading or manipulating strams of binary data. interact with streams in context of things like TCP or video strams,  and file system ops.
#### Event loop
The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations — despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.
#### Non-blocking or Asynchronous I/O 
Operators are functions that build on the observables foundation to enable sophisticated manipulation ossf collections. For, RxJS defines operators such as map(), filter(), concat(), and flatMap().
